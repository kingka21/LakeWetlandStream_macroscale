This repository has the data and code for the analysis of lake, wetland, and stream biotic and abiotic properties at the national scale. The code supports the manuscript K. King, K.S. Cheruvelil, A. Pollard. 2019. Drivers and spatial structure of abiotic and biotic properties of lakes, wetlands, and streams at the national scale. Ecological Applications. 

**The 'scripts' folder includes the following:**  
01_lake_data_wrangling that includes methods for combining EPA National Lakes Assessment data  
02_stream_data_wrangling that includes methods for combining EPA Natrional Rivers and Streams Assessment data  
03_wetland_data_wrangling that includes methods for combining EPA National Wetland Condition Assessment data  
04_semivatiogram_analysis that includes methods used for semivariogram analysis  
05_RandomForest that includes methods used for Random Forest analysis  
06_Figures that includes code for figures that are presented in the manuscript

The data folder includes large datasets of thousands of water bodies at the U.S. conterminous scale as well as shapefiles of the EPA's agglomerated ecoregions. These datasets are provided in the github repository for convenience, however, these data and their meta-data are published at King, K. 2018. Lake, wetland, and stream biotic and abiotic properties from the National Aquatic Resource Surveys. Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity. doi:10.5063/F13J3B5D.
