# Lake, wetland, and stream biotic and abiotic properties have similar drivers and spatial structure at the national scale 

This repository has the data and code for the analysis of lake, wetland, and stream biotic and abiotic properties at the national scale. The data folder includes large datasets of thousands of water bodies at the U.S. conterminous scale as well as shapefiles of the EPA's agglomerated ecoregions. Scripts include classification and regression tree analysis (CART) and semivariogram analysis.
